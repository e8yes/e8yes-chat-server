/**
 * @brief The ShlFeatureBuilder class It helps extract the Suggestive Hotspot Links (SHL) features
 * from the Gomoku board and provies data strctures to allow effcient incremental update. The
 * SHL features are extracted by looking at all possible links from all the double contour
 * positions for both stone types (See LinkStats for how a link is defined). An adjusted count is
 * then assigned for each link and stone type and is caluated as follow:
 *
 * adjusted_count = |raw_count + move_advantage - 0.5*holes - blockage|^2.5. Move advantage is set
 * to 1 if the next_move_stone_type is the same as the adjusted count's stone type. Otherwise, it is
 * set to 0.5. If the next_move_stone_type is not supplied, move_advantage is default to 1.
 *
 * For each stone typep, the top 2 links are selected at each position based on this adjusted count
 * and are called the primary and secondary counts, respectively. These counts constitutes the
 * raw_map.
 *
 * Then it computes the SHL score using those adjusted counts for each position:
 *
 * shl_score = primary_count_black + secondary_count_black + primary_count_white +
 * secondary_count_white
 *
 * Eventually, it ranks each position's adjusted count by the shl_score and selects the top K
 * positions. Other positions are erased. With the unsuppressed positions, the adjusted counts are
 * normalized by the sum of the remaining SHL scores. This gives the final SHL map.
